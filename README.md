# Not Enough Bullets

## Introduction
A 2D Shoot-em-up game without bullets created for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2018. Instead of there being bullets the player must bounce enemies off their shield into other enemies to rack up points and progress. The game currently features 6 different enemy types and only 1 level.
